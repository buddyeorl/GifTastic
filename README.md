Use case for Giphy API

Overview

I'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. In this Task I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.


Instructions:

You'll be presented with a set of buttons, every time you click on a Button it will create a set of Gifs related to that button.

If you want to search a different keywords, first create a button, to do this, simply type the keyword in the text box and and click on the button Go! Or press Enter. The button will be displayed at the end of the list of buttons, Click on it to see the new set of gifs related to that button.
